# integral-calculator

This project is an upgrade to C++ and objects from an old C university homework.

The code allows the calculation of definite integrals of functions with the following numerical methods:

* [Trapezoidal Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule)

* [Simpson's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule)

* [Romberg's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method)
